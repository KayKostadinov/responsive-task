## Stack choice
I suppose this task was meant to be completed using Wordpress and PHP, however my exposure to those technologies has been limited so far. I decided to use what I currently know well for best results.

# Stack:
- HTML
- CSS + Sass
- JavaScript

# Methodology:
- Mobile-first approach
- Fluid responsiveness (things shouldn't look off between screen size breakpoints)
- Modular implementation: sass files broken up for reusability
